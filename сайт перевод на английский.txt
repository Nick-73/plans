The Hitler`s command called Pskov “the key to the front doors of Leningrad.”
Attempts to liberate Pskov in February-April 1944 were unsuccessful, on average they managed to advance 18-20 km, this was due to difficult terrain: many rivers and swamps, the Wehrmacht soldiers stubbornly resisted.
From October 1942 to 1944, the construction of the "Panther" defensive line continued, and a significant part of this fortification passed through the Pskov Plain. It was a very serious defensive line.

The area of military operations is the Pskov region near the Eastern border of Estonia and the Lithuanian SSR and a piece of the territory of the Leningrad region. This is a hill, heavily swampy in places, many rivers and lakes, the forest is located heterogeneously in places, many highways and dirt roads, despite the fact that the "Panther" frontier was not finally build by the Nazis.
By the beginning of 1944, it was a fairly developed defense system about 170 km long and from 4 to 6 km wide. This is a system of strong points connected by trenches and messages were sent. The cities of Pskov and the Island were covered with special positions, there were many pillboxes and bunkers, a lot of anti-tank obstacles. In general, the disguise is well thought out. The breakthrough of such a powerful milestone required special preparation.
